# Synthesis of multiqubit Clifford+T circuits

This's my first adventure in quantum computing world.
I manged to implement an algorithm that generates a qunatum circuit based on a given matrix;
The algorithm is proposed in the paper "Exact synthesis of multiqubit Clifford+T circuits" cited as: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.0506.pdf.
Run Test.ipynb to see the results or see generated results in tests folder;
To run Test.ipynb, install qiskit, numpy and sympy libraries.
I hope you enjoy it :)
